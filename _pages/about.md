I am a second-year student in the [MSCS](https://cse.wustl.edu/academics/graduate/MS-in-Computer-Science.html) program at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/). I am looking for a PhD position starting in Fall 2025.

My research interest is security and privacy issues in AI-powered computing systems. My goal is to identify and mitigate emerging security risks associated with AI technologies. I aim to provide a secure environment for users to benefit from AI advancements, and a reliable platform for developers to exploit AI's potential while maintaining robust security standards.

I am currently working with [Prof. Umar Iqbal](https://umariqbal.com/index.html), where we are developing a secure platform for LLM-based systems. Prior to my focus on security research, I spent two years in [Prof. Xiaojun Quan](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaojunquan)'s group, where I co-authored papers that were published in top conferences, focusing on NLP.
