Our demonstration, operating on an IoT device, achieves an impressive nearly 100 percent detection accuracy for all 11 required items and 5 distractors in real-time. This accomplishment is complemented by the playback of high-quality voice prompts generated by Language Model Model (LLM). The seamless integration of detection capabilities and sophisticated voice prompts showcases the robustness and effectiveness of our system, highlighting its potential for practical application in real-world scenarios.
